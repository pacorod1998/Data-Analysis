# [Project 1: Uber Case Study - Data Analysis with Python](https://github.com/pacorod1998/Uber-Case-Study/tree/main)

DailyUber provides the 2016 data. By using this data find out the demand and supply Analysis gap of the cab. The main objective of this project is to analyse the data on Uber Request data. Through the analysis of data, we can find some important insights.

*  App Openings (Eyeballs) = Customers who launch the app looking for riders. It is a good measure of demand
*   Zeroes = Customers who open the app and see no cars in the area.
*   Request = Customers who make requests for a car.
*   Completed Trip = The point from when a customer is picked


**Objectives for Analysis**

1.   Which date had the most completed trips during the two weeks?
2.   What was the highest number of completed trips within a 24-hour period?
3.   Which hour of the day had the most requests during the two-week period?
4.   What percentages of all zeroes during the two week period occurred on weekends (Friday at 5 pm to Sunday at 3 am)?
5.   What is the weighted average ratio of completed trips per driver during the two week period?
6.   In drafting a driver schedule in terms of 8 hour shifts, when are the busiest 8 consecutive hours over the two week period in terms of unique requests? A new shift starts every 8 hours. Assume that a driver will work the same shift each day.
7.   True or False: Driver supply always increases when demand increases during the two week period.
8.   If you could add 5 drivers to any single hour of every day during the two week period, which hour should you add them to?
9.  True or False: There is exactly two weeks of data in this analysis
10.  Looking at the data from all two weeks, which time might make the most sense to consider a true "end day" instead of midnight? (i.e when are supply and demand at both their natural minimums)

# [Project 2: Banking Customer Loyalty Analysis Modeling - Data Analysis & Modeling with Python](https://github.com/pacorod1998/Banking-Customer-Loyalty-Analysis-Modeling)

**Background**

* Despite bank’s continuous efforts to attract and retain customers, the banking industry faces a persistent challenge in the form of customer turnover, leading to financial losses and reduced customer satisfaction.
* It is advantageous for banks to identify the factors influencing a customer's decision to depart from the institution.

**Objectives**

* Examine the rate of customer turnover within the bank, as it is essential to comprehend the reasons behind customer departures.
* Develop a Machine Learning Model capable of identifying the key factors that greatly impact customer turnover or attrition.
* Choose the most reliable model that will attach a probability to the churn to make it easier for customer service to target right customer in order to minimize their efforts to prevent customers churn.

# [Project 3: Tableau - Wie schnell fährt der Zug?](https://github.com/pacorod1998/Tableau---Wie-schnell-f-hrt-der-Zug-/tree/main)

**Background**
* The following Dashboard is about the trains in Germany from the Deutschebahn company, where the mapped routes allow you to see how fast the trains are on the respective segments.
* This is an Exploratory dashboard, which means it doesn't answer any specific question. Instead, it is a tool that lets the audience search for their own answers. You can click on the attached link to interact with the visualization.
